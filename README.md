Projects will be stored as posts in a blog instead of one single page for clarity's sake.
The site uses the [jekyll-compose](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) plugin. To add a new post with title "My New Post" run the following command in the root folder of the jekyll project
```
bundle exec jekyll compose "My New Post"
```
